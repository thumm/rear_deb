	Currently there is no support to detect the OS and VERSION without LSB support.
	Please either install the LSB package (that supplies the 'lsb_release' command)
	or improve $PRODUCT to handle this situation better.

	As an alternative you can manually override OS_VENDOR and OS_VERSION in the
	'$CONFIG_DIR/os.conf' file. Please be sure to test your setup !

	See '$SHARE_DIR/lib/config-functions.sh' for more details about this matter.
