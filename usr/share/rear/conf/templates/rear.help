01~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~07
0fRelax-and-Recover07 is a disaster recovery and system migration tool.

This help is part of the rescue image, you are here because you plan to recover
or migrate a previously made backup of your system, including the disk layout
as it was when the rescue environment was created.

The menu gives an overview of the various system rescue environments stored on
the boot media you used for booting this screen (either USB, PXE or ISO). For
each of the systems one or more rescue environments are stored, when browsing
through the images more information is shown below the menu.

Once you boot into one of the rescue images, you can start recover the system.
You can do this by typing: 0erear recover07

cfCAUTION:0f Once you start recovery, it is likely the actions cannot be undone and
         you may loose anything stored on the physical disks of the system.07
