rear (1.13.0+20120911git5e11e6d-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release (Closes: #683422)
  * Changes in upstream sources
    The Makefiles have to be changed to install the documentation in the right
    location (see debian/patches/01-debian.patch). An upstream patch was
    rejected because the location is distribution specific (see
    https://github.com/rear/rear/pull/140#commitcomment-1654132).
  * Lintian override package-contains-empty-directory
    The empty dirs are template dirs where custom bash-scripts can be placed.
    They are created to avoid mistakes creating these dirs eg. with wrong names.
