Comment: The sources are available at Github and have been extracted
 from the repository. For a untagged version the orig-
 tar ball has been created by:
   git clone git://github.com/rear/rear.git rear
   cd rear
   OUTNAME=rear_$(git describe | cut -d"-" -f2)+git$(git log -n 1 --format="%h")
   git ls-tree -r --name-only --full-tree master | \
     tar -czf ../${OUTNAME}.orig.tar.gz --exclude-vcs \
       --transform="s,^,${OUTNAME}/,S" --files-from=-
 For a tagged version (e.g. rear-1.13.0)
   git clone git://github.com/rear/rear.git rear
   cd rear
   git checkout rear-1.13.0
   git ls-tree -r --name-only --full-tree rear-1.13.0 | \
     tar -czf ../$(git describe).orig.tar.gz --exclude-vcs \
       --transform="s,^,$(git describe)/,S" --files-from=-
