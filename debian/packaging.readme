My personal hints for packaging

- version scheme
  For packages based on not released git development commit
    <last released version>+git<abbreviated commit hash>-<debian revision>
  with
    <abbreviated commit hash> == git log -n 1 --format="%h"

- Howto generate a orig-tar-gz
  Call
    ./debian/rules get-orig-source

- Testing with pbuilder
  Using pbuilder-dist with symlinks in /usr/local/bin
    pbuilder-unstable build *.dsc
  Results are in ~/pbuilder
